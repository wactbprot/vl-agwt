\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}


\subsection{ Angewant}
``Angewant'' is a joint research project of six representatives from the weighing industry, the construction industry and science. The latter is divided into the National Metrology Institute PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt), a regional agency for innovation and European affairs as well as the Institute for applied labor science (IfaA), responsible for socio-economics and human factors \cite{Ottersboeck2020System}.

\end{itemize}

Within the framework of the EMPIR project “Communication and validation of smart data in IoT-networks” SmartCom \cite{SmartCom}, see Fig. \ref{fig:SmartCom_logo}, the metrological and technical baseline for the exchange of metrological data has been established, in the form of the Digital System of Units (D-SI) and the framework conditions for DCCs. In order to validate the quality of data being exchanged, a novel test module for D-SI based data has been developed and integrated into the existing and well-established online validation system TraCIM [cite?] (Traceability for computational-intensive metrology, a service run at PTB). The project partners consortium consists of universities, metrology and research institutes as well as companies from weighting industry acting in EU.

    \caption{SmartCom project aims in developing the basis for an unambiguous, universal, safe and uniform communication of metrological data in IoT. }
    \label{fig:SmartCom_logo}
\end{figure}

Aim of workpackage 5 of SmartCom project is to develop a reliable, easy to use, validated and secure online conformity assessment procedure designed for cloud system applications for legal metrology. In this section of work, requirements for a user‐oriented and easy‐to‐establish online conformity assessment system that fulfils the general needs of legal preconditions was developed. The research focused on industrial users who develop sophisticated networks within digital networks and whose previous developments could not be taken to market due to national law restrictions.

\subsection{Vacuum metrology group}

The vacuum metrology group of PTB was founded in 1966 at the institute
Berlin \cite{jou19, jou04}. In addition to research and development,
the calibration of vacuum gauges falls within the laboratory's
responsibilities. To this objective, the group maintains the
realization and dissemination of the pressure scale from
$1\times10^{-9}\,$Pa to $1\,$kPa is. To cover this pressure
range, methods based on different physical laws are
realized by primary standards. These standards are used for research
but also for the calibration of vacuum gauges for customers. The customers
of the metrology group at PTB range from industry, calibration laboratories
to other metrology institutes.

At a glace, a calibration process runs as follows: Customers sent
their vacuum gauges which are installed at a primary standard. The
readings of these gauges are compared to a set of pressures generated
by means of the standard called the calibration pressures. The
results of the comparison are stated in a calibration certificate
as the deviation between reading and calibration pressure and the associated
measurement uncertainties. The number of calibrations was rising since the
founding of the laboratory: over the last decade from about 120 to
170 per year.  In order to manage this increase, efforts have been
made since the mid-1990s to automate the calibration systems
\cite{jouce3, joufm3}.

Digitization was also a design goal for the most
recently completed primary standard SE3. Here, the automation of
entire calibration process, from order acceptance to measurement and
return shipment, was thought along from the beginning. SE3 is used for
customer calibrations since 2019. Since 2020 the calibration results
have also been offered routinely in the form of a Digital Calibration
Certificate (DCC) described in section \ref{ssec:dcc}.  In section
\ref{ssec:vl-work} the complete workflow is presented based on the SE3
processes.

% In this process, emphasis is placed on
% the use of open source software.

\section{Materials \& Methods}

\subsection{Digital Calibration Certificate}
\label{ssec:dcc}

To ensure the quality of the measuring equipment in industrial
processes, gauges have to be calibrated on a regular interval. The
DCC is an effort of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt to provide
a unified way of transferring calibration results from machine (issuing authority) to
machine (calibration customer) without discontinuity of media. It
serves for the proof of metrological traceability and enhances 
manufacturing and quality monitoring processes.

The DCC is based on the internationally approved exchange format
XML (Extensible Markup Language). Beside the calibration results it
contains administrative information concerning the recipient and
issuing authority. It describes the methods used for calibration as well as
influence and environmental conditions.

% When designing the dcc, particular emphasis was placed on versatility.
% Units are given in machine-readable form. 

%% Example  Vacuum metrology group(?): receives DCC for voltage,
% issues pressure DCCs. e.g.:
% In many/some cases a laboratory is
% an issuer but also a receiver of a Digital Calibration Certificates... 

%% https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/forschung-entwicklung/mit-metrologie-in-die-zukunft/herausforderung-digitalisierung/kernziel1einheitlichkeitim/digital-calibration-certificate-dcc.html

% An important element of the DCC is the representation of units and
% measurement data with measurement uncertainties. For this purpose, a
% proposal for a data model was developed in the Opens external link
% in new windowEMPIR project SmartCom: the D-SI.


\textbf{OB: is it a subsection for SmartCom team?}

\subsection{IT at Vacuum metrology group}

\subsection{IT at Vacuum metrology group}

Statically typed languages and relational databases are well suited
for well-defined requirements with a clearly formulated problem space.
The attempt to model the processes in the vacuum metrology lab with
these tools was abandoned after some setbacks in favour of an approach
with a schema-free database and dynamically typed languages.
The NoSQL database CouchDB \cite{couch} is the central infrastructure
element. CouchDB belongs to the class of document stores. It uses
Multi-Version Concurrency Control \cite{mvcc} and supports a master-master
replication mechanism. This mechanism is used to keep the database
instances running on each of the lab's measuring computers in sync.
Data is stored in self-contained JSON documents accessible via
REST \cite{fielding2000architectural} oriented http interfaces. The
modelling of the processes in the laboratory is achieved with the help of
these documents. There are a large number of them with a wide variety
of tasks. Examples are:

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[angle=0, width=0.4\columnwidth]{pictures/vaclab_workflow.pdf}
    \caption{Workflow of calibration services in the vacuum metrology group. }
    \label{fig:vl-work}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \emph{servers document} is used to automate the
    replication of data.
  \item The \emph{todo documents} (\emph{tdo} in
    Figure~\ref{fig:vl-work}) describe the aim of the
    calibration. Here, target pressures, target temperatures and the
    number of measurement repetitions are defined.
  \item The \emph{measurement procedure definition} documents describe
    the steps of a calibration that have to be carried out. These
    descriptions are formulated in terms of a domain specific language
    with the idea that everything can be arranged in a sequential
    series of parallel steps.
  \item The \emph{calibration} documents (\emph{cal} in
    Figure~\ref{fig:vl-work}) are combinations of various
    sub-documents. They consist of dates, presettings, calibration
    objects with their parameters and serial numbers. Furthermore,
    fundamental physical constants, conversion factors as well as the raw data and
    the analysis of a calibration
    % of one customer gauge  and one specific calibration method
    is included.
    \item The \emph{DCC} documents are JSON documents with a structure
      analogue to the XML structure of the DCC. They are each derived
      from a calibration document and used to generate the DCC in the
      XML format by means of a template system.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Vacuum metrology group workflow}
\label{ssec:vl-work}

    \caption{Workflow of vacuum metrology group. }
    \label{fig:vl-work}
\end{figure}

Workflow along the working steps at SE3
\begin{itemize}
  
\item starts with CalibrationRequest by e-mail or via REST interface:
  planning of the calibration: Who, where, when, how many devices
  planning document (\emph{pla} in  Figure~\ref{fig:vl-work}) gives offer.pdf
\item Customer gives confirmation leading to generation of confirmation.pdf, declaration.pdf
\item planning document is converted to bureaucracy document (\emph{bur} in  Figure~\ref{fig:vl-work}) and a
  calibration document for each of the devices requested for
  calibration
\item the gauges arrive, measurement maintainer (name is stored in
  calibration document) checks serial numbers and settings
\item calibration document is supplemented by the calibration objects 
    (\emph{cob1}, \emph{cob2} ...  in  Figure~\ref{fig:vl-work}) document
\item gauges are attached to SE3 (up to ten gauges in one calibration
  run)
\item after pump down, a specific measurement operation definition is
  executed: outgassing, add volume, leak test, checks for T-sensors and
  pressure devices are tested and measured
\item calibration processes are also defined as an measurement
  operation definition document
\item for one target point about 400 steps are executed
\item about 15 target points for a usual calibration
\item several calibration methods depending on the pressure range e.g.
\item - continuous expansion method [\cite{} ]
\item - static expansion method [\cite{} ] expansion
\item - direct comparison
\item - use of pressure balances
\item again: one calibration document for each of the methods
\item automated preliminary analysis for every completed target
  pressure
\item detailed analysis if all target pressures are measured
\item calculation of additional parameters like offset scatter,
  viscosity parameters, temperature corrections
  
\item repeat the measurement of suspicious target points
\item generation of certificate document (\emph{cert} in  Figure~\ref{fig:vl-work}): 
    combination of all calibration documents for a certain device
\item certificate document used to generate LaTeX source and a pdf
  version of the calibration certificate
\item second analysis whereby the cert is the data source: a second
  program crosschecks the measured and calculated data
\item generation of JSON DCC (\emph{dcc} in  Figure~\ref{fig:vl-work}) 
    document used to generate the DCC in xml
  format 
\item validation of DCC via REST interface
\item Status update !!
\item shipping the device back to the customer: bureaucracy
  document gives shipping-label.pdf, shipping-order.pdf
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Declaration of Conformity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use Case
    \item XML Schema (take info from D6)
    \item Workflow: Upload, Download, Creation
    \item Implentation independent service integration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Workflow: Upload, Download, Creation}
The online conformity assessment system consists of the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
    
\item A unified user interface; a browser application for viewing documents, applying and validating the electronic signature.
\item A security concept for the transmission of metrological information outside the restricted and economic environment [9], [10], using Representational State Transfer (REST), a well-established architectural style using the HTTP protocol.
\item An XML‐based validation schema [14], including frameworks of the EU DoC. The exchange of documents will be enabled by an online storage system. 
Similar to the procedure described in section V, the client uploads an XML file with the device information, such as type, manufacturer etc. As the next step the XML file is secured, by application of a digital signature [24]. The signed XML file is then uploaded to a OOS for the verification. The verification is based on EU DoC requirements. As a test output, the client receives a success or failure statement and a human readable version of the XML file. The entire workflow of the verification process was realised on the platform developed within the AnGeWaNt project [25].
